This is the source code I wrote for a class project to create a manager for WAD files, a type of data storage file used for Doom-engine-based software. The libWad folder contains the code for the library that handles interacting with WAD files, like reading, writing to and creating WAD files, and the libWad folder contains the code for the file daemon that uses FUSE to mount WAD files to a custom Linux distro we used in class called Reptilian.
