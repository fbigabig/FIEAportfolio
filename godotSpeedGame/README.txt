This folder contains 2 of the key scripts for my game I developed: FLOOR IT WE BALL. 
The full project includes over 25 scripts, so I chose two here that contained central code functions: the player script, which handles most of the gameplay, and a global script that acts a singleton, and contains functions and data used across the game.
To see the game and test it, check https://erifigured.itch.io/floor-it-we-ball
