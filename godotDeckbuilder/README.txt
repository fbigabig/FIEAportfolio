This is a sampling of GDSscript (Language used by the Godot game engine) code I wrote for a deckbuilder grid battler game prototype. The game did not make it past the demo stage with a few cards and a couple enemy types, but working on it taught me a lot about randomization, deck management, working with a grid, interlinking scripts and entities, and how to use Godot in general, as this was my first major godot project.
Included are the scripts cardUI.gd, which handled the UI for choosing cards as well as the deck system itself, enemy_base.gd, a base class inherited by all enemies, enemy.gd, a basic enemy which inherits from enemy_base, and player.gd, which handles player movement and spawning in the player attacks through communication with cardUI.
